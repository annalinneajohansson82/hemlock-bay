Hemlock Bay

Purpose of this document

This document exists to explain the intent, tone, and graphical profile of the Hemlock Bay project to AI tools, collaborators, and future contributors.

It is not lore. It is not marketing copy. It is a practical reference describing how Hemlock Bay should feel, look, and behave when generating or modifying content, design, or code.


---

Project intent

Hemlock Bay is a fictional coastal town and institutional ecosystem, presented as if it were a real historical place with archives, authorities, and records.

The project prioritizes:

World-building through material culture

Institutional plausibility over spectacle

Subtle unease rather than overt horror

Authority, age, and restraint


Hemlock Bay should never feel playful, ironic, or self-aware.


---

Core tone

Hemlock Bay communicates in the voice of an established institution.

The tone is:

Formal

Archival

Scholarly

Slightly oppressive

Calm and assured


Avoid:

Casual language

Modern marketing tone

Humor or whimsy

Over-explanation


If something feels friendly or enthusiastic, it is likely incorrect.


---

Aesthetic direction

Primary inspiration

Late Victorian and early 20th century institutional print

Museums, archives, asylums, apothecaries, learned societies

Scientific plates, catalogues, internal memoranda


This is closer to a museum archive than a brand website.


---

Visual principles

Color

Warm black as the dominant background

Off-white / parchment for primary text

Muted brass or gold used sparingly for:

Rules

Keylines

Emphasis



Avoid:

Bright colors

High-saturation gold

Pure white



---

Layout

Content should feel contained and catalogued

Prefer framed layouts over full-bleed sections

Use margins deliberately

Avoid card-based or modular SaaS-style layouts


Nothing should feel airy or playful.


---

Typography

Serif or period-appropriate typefaces

Strong hierarchy

Print-like rhythm


Approved typefaces (must be available via Google Fonts):

Libre Baskerville – primary body text and long-form reading

Cormorant Garamond – headings, institutional titles, display text

Cinzel – occasional use for small caps, mottos, crests, or formal inscriptions


Guidelines:

Headings are larger than modern web norms

Body text is slightly smaller with generous line-height

Narrower text measure (approximately 60–70 characters)

Metadata styled in small caps, italics, or subdued color


Avoid:

Sans-serif UI fonts as primary text

Over-mixing typefaces

Decorative fonts for body copy



---

Ornamentation

Thin horizontal rules are encouraged

Period-appropriate decorative elements are allowed

Ornamentation should feel printed, engraved, or typeset


Examples of acceptable decoration:

Simple flourishes or dividers inspired by Victorian print

Small centered ornaments in rules

Plate-style numbering (Roman numerals)

Subtle typographic symbols


Rules:

Decorations must be flat (no depth, glow, or shadow)

Decorations should never dominate content

Use sparingly and consistently


Avoid:

Modern UI decoration patterns

Excessive flourishes

Anything playful, cute, or whimsical



---

Interaction and motion

Minimal motion only

No decorative animation

Hover states should feel like ink darkening, not glowing

Respect prefers-reduced-motion



---

Accessibility and restraint

Accessibility is mandatory and non-negotiable.

WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements must be met

Semantic structure must be preserved

Keyboard navigation must be clear and visible


Accessibility should be integrated quietly, not advertised.


---

Lore discipline

AI tools must follow strict discipline regarding content:

Do not invent new institutions, histories, or facts

Do not expand lore unless explicitly instructed

Do not embellish or dramatize existing material


If uncertain, preserve ambiguity rather than adding detail.


---

Hard no

The following must never be introduced unless explicitly requested:

AI-generated art, illustrations, textures, or images that have not been explicitly prompted for creation

Invented visual assets presented as archival material

Decorative imagery added "to enhance mood" without instruction


AI tools must not autonomously generate or insert artwork. Visual material is only allowed when it is:

Explicitly requested

Clearly intentional

Reviewed as part of a conscious design decision



---

Summary

Hemlock Bay is an exercise in restraint.

It should feel:

Old

Serious

Authoritative

Slightly unsettling


When in doubt, choose the option that feels quieter, heavier, and more archival.
