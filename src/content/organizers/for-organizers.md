Hemlock Bay is an artistic craft project situated at the intersection of fiction, natural history, and darker storytelling traditions. The project takes shape through hand-crafted objects, printed matter, and small-scale installations, often presented as if they originate from an old museum, archive, or cabinet of curiosities.

Hemlock Bay is well suited to contexts where audiences value narrative, tactility, and the slightly unconventional.

### What is offered

At markets and events, Hemlock Bay participates as an exhibiting maker with on-site sales. The assortment typically includes:

- Hand-crafted objects and decorative items produced in small editions
- Printed matter, illustrations, and paper-based products
- Objects where reuse, patina, and material history are integral to the expression

The aesthetic is gothic and vintage-inspired, with elements of gallows humour and fictional documentation, but without shock value or extreme content. The focus remains on craft, form, and storytelling.

### For shops and permanent settings

Hemlock Bay is suitable for:

- Curated shops with a focus on design, art, literature, museum-shop aesthetics, or alternative expressions
- Temporary pop-ups or themed exhibitions
- Small production runs or selected objects adapted to a shop’s profile

Collaborations can be structured flexibly, such as commission-based sales, small-scale wholesale, or temporary installations.

### Presentation and audience engagement

At physical events, the creator behind Hemlock Bay is present and happy to engage with visitors about:

- Craft processes and material choices
- Reuse and sustainability
- Inspiration, fiction, and the narratives carried by the objects

The project is often appreciated by audiences drawn to slower, more reflective experiences, and who enjoy taking time for conversation.

### Sustainability and working methods

Hemlock Bay operates on a small scale and avoids mass production. A significant portion of materials are reused or sourced second-hand, and minor variations between objects are considered part of their value rather than imperfections. Production is slow and exploratory, prioritising quality and expression over volume.
